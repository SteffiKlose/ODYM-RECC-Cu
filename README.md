# ODYM-RECC Cu

This is a stand-alone dynamic material system model of the copper cycle which eventually will be integrated in the ODYM-RECC Project (https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM). 
The model is created to model the copper demand for the Electricity Generation Sector based on output data from the Integrated Assessent Model MESSAGE developed at the 
International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) (http://message.iiasa.ac.at).

The features of ODYM-RECC Copper:
For Electricity generation technologies:
- Transform MESSAGE output data into ODYM-RECC data format
- Derive primary and secondary copper demand associated with MESSAGE Scenarios
- Output energy demand derived from the copper demand


### Prerequisites

You need to adapt the RECC_paths file to your own working directory
